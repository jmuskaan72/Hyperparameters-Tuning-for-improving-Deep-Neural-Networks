# Hyperparameters-Tuning-for-improving-Deep-Neural-Networks
To teach you the "magic" of getting deep learning to work well. 
Rather than the deep learning process being a black box, you will understand what drives performance, and be able to more systematically get good results. 

It will help you in gaining knowledge for:
- Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications. 
- Be able to effectively use the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking, 
- Be able to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence. 
- Understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance
- Be able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow.
